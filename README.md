# Telegram bot for —Åollection and analysis of information about company mentions in social networks
## Project description
[This bot](https://t.me/comapny_mentions) was created in order to find mentions of some companies interesting to the user on sites such as [meduza.io](https://meduza.io) and [rbc.ru/business](https://www.rbc.ru/business). Every 4 hours there is a check for new articles and mentions of a certain list of companies in them. Using NLP-analysis, a conclusion is made about the tone of mentioning in the article: positive, negative or neutral. This can be useful for stock market players in the course of building a strategy for their investment portfolios or for ordinary people who monitor the situation in the country and its economy.
